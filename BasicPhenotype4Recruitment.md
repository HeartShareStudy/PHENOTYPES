# HeartShare Recruitment Query

*Draft Date: 2022-07-18*

Below criteria can be customized by sites to identify patients for study recruitment. General study inclusion/exclusion criteria are found in section A, assessed for difficulty in extracting from structured EHR data (green = easier, red = harder). Section B provides a more basic phenotype. ICD codes follow.

## A. General Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

### Inclusion Criteria

1. Age ≥ 30 years

2. EF ≥ 50%

3. Definition of HFpEF: signs and symptoms of HF, NYHA II-IV, and at least one of the following:

    a. Elevated BNP (>100) / NTproBNP (>300/900 AF)

    b. Prior HHF (for true HF) 

    c. PCWP rest > 15mmHg or exercise > 25mmHg for supine or PCWP/CO > 2 for upright

    d. Elevated H2FPEF score (≥5) or HFA-PEFF score (≥5)

### Exclusion Criteria

1. Life expectancy < 1 years

2. Primary cardiomyopathy (including amyloid) or pulmonary arterial hypertension

3. Prior EF < 40%

4. Significant valvular heart disease (> mild stenosis or any MS, > mild AR, > mod MR)

5. Any planned cardiac surgery or intervention for other indications

12. Condition that may preclude participation, or patient unable to consent

13. Current acute decompensated heart failure

14. Pregnant

15. Uncontrolled HR (> 110bpm) at time of screening

## B. Potential Basic Phenotype:

1. Age ≥ 30 years (at time of first HF code)

2. Signs and symptoms of HF (2 outpt codes for HF on distinct encounters or 1 inpatient code)
