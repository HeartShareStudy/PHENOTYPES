Working closely with informatics and data science professionals across the consortium, the EHRI and DP WG will ensure that the processes for acquiring and integrating data – including extant cohorts, EHR, and imaging data – are sound, secure, effective, and adherent with the research protocols of HeartShare. 1.2 EHR Integration Purpose The goal is to functionally integrate clinical care data for HF patients and their comparator group from the HeartShare Clinical Centers (CCs). These data sets are not intended for discovery of novel HFpEF phenotypes. Rather they will be used to: Describe and characterize the scope, composition and ready availability of EHR data for HF patients across HeartShare Aid the identification and enrollment of HF and HFpEF patients with bespoke clinical features into the HeartShare Study if and when needed Provide a platform for the real-world application of EHR-based HFpEF phenotypes which can be used to find patient sub-populations and drive iterative phenotype validation and refinement. Resource for investigators interested in multi-site analyses e.g. study the uptake of specific treatments, gather pilot data to support ancillary grants, or trainees working on their projects 1.3 Whose EHR Records Are Collected and for What Time Span? Broadly speaking the EHR records that are included in the HeartShare data calls are for Heart Failure patients and their comparator groups from the HeartShare Clinical Centers (CC). For these cohorts, we aim to collect retrospective longitudinal data. In other words we are looking to gather as complete a longitudinal picture of these patients’ HF journey as we can, even prior to the launch of the HeartShare study or even their HF diagnosis. Based on technical feasibility, analysis aims, and regulatory requirements the retrospective data set may be collected once (one time) or collected once then periodically updated (one time with “top offs”). In the latter case, the DP and EHRI WG in consultation with the HeartShare CCs will determine the adequate scope and frequency of the data set updates. It is also useful to highlight the two cohort categories below: 1.3.1 The Entire Pool of HF Patients with EHR Records This is a broad category and intended to include all HF patients and their appropriate comparator groups with EHR records at HeartShare CCs. Since this category is broad and includes current and past patients who are not HeartShare participants, the regulatory framework for collecting and analyzing their EHR data will depend on obtaining a waiver of HIPAA authorization from the local IRBs and privacy boards. 1.3.2 Patients Enrolled in HeartShare This category is a subset of the category above and includes patients who are enrolled into HeartShare studies via the Eureka platform. These participants provide informed consent and HIPAA authorization for sharing their EHR data, so the regulatory pathway for accrual and sharing of their health information is likely to be more permissive. The accrual of these patients will be ongoing and will include ongoing encounters with the HeartShare CC HF clinics; therefore, this group will likely require regular EHR data aggregation and “topping off” during their active participation in HeartShare studies. This category includes participants in the HeartShare HF Registry (previously referred to as the “light touch registry”), the HeartShare Deep Phenotyping Cohort (DPC), and their comparator groups. 1.4 What EHR Data Are Collected? The data domains that will be included will be prioritized based on their relevance to the HeartShare scientific goals. Informed by the overall aims of HeartShare and the unfolding of the main studies, the DP and EHRI WG will work to define the EHR domains following an incremental approach: 1.5 How Will EHR Data Be Extracted and Prepared for Analysis? There will be two steps for data extraction and harmonization into a format amenable to uniform analysis across all HeartShare CCs. 1.5.1 Local EHR Query: Cohort Identification and Domain Selection. This step is highly variable and depends on the local EHR data stores within each CC. This step will rely on cohort definitions to identify the appropriate patients. In this step, only the domains salient to the current data calls will be included (filter-in approach). 1.5.2 Extract, Transform, Load: Harmonization Using the OMOP CDM In this step, the exported records with the associated domain field values will be transformed into relational database tables that are concordant with the OHDSI OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). 1.6 Where Will the EHR Data Be Analyzed? The HeartShare DTC will work with the HeartShare CCs to develop appropriate data transfer agreements (DTA) that cover the different subsets of patient populations in the shared EHR data. Furthermore, all institutions whose investigators will require access to the data will need to sign a data use agreement (DUA). There are two workflows for data analysis. Scenario 1: local analysis because a DTA is not feasible for a given population or a DTA has not been signed yet, followed by pooling of analysis results Scenario 2: pooling of data into the a central location managed by the HeartShare DTC followed by one central analysis "],["active-ehr-data-call.html", "2 Active EHR Data Call 2.1 General Description and Notes 2.2 Cohort 2.3 Table or Result Specs", " 2 Active EHR Data Call Status: DRAFT 2.1 General Description and Notes This is the first data call requesting the creation of OMOP CDM compatible table at the HeartShare Clinical Centers. It builds upon the initial heart data call presented during the in-person HeartShare AMP meeting on September 29, 2022, and extends it to familiarize the HeartShare CCs with the OMOP CDM data table generation workflow. 2.2 Cohort Selection criteria: follow DTC guidelines to identify HF patients (all EFs) in the EHR 2016 onwards (ICD-10 implementation date) Age: \\(\\geq\\) 18, if used age cut off at 30 as had been previously discussed just indicate that Presence of ICD-10 Codes: 2 outpatient encounters or 1 inpatient (for list of codes see below) Please don’t use any additional filtering criteria.
