Working closely with informatics and data science professionals across the consortium, the EHRI and DP WG will ensure that the processes for acquiring and integrating data – including extant cohorts, EHR, and imaging data – are sound, secure, effective, and adherent with the research protocols of HeartShare. 1.2 EHR Integration Purpose The goal is to functionally integrate clinical care data for HF patients and their comparator group from the HeartShare Clinical Centers (CCs). These data sets are not intended for discovery of novel HFpEF phenotypes. Rather they will be used to: Describe and characterize the scope, composition and ready availability of EHR data for HF patients across HeartShare Aid the identification and enrollment of HF and HFpEF patients with bespoke clinical features into the HeartShare Study if and when needed Provide a platform for the real-world application of EHR-based HFpEF phenotypes which can be used to find patient sub-populations and drive iterative phenotype validation and refinement. Resource for investigators interested in multi-site analyses (e.g., study the uptake of specific treatments, gather pilot data to support ancillary grants) 1.3 Whose EHR Records Are Collected and for What Time Span? Broadly speaking the EHR records that are included in the HeartShare data calls are for Heart Failure patients and their comparator groups from the HeartShare Clinical Centers (CC). For these cohorts, we aim to collect retrospective longitudinal data. In other words, we are looking to gather as complete a longitudinal picture of these patients’ HF journey as we can, even prior to the launch of the HeartShare study or even their HF diagnosis. Based on technical feasibility, analysis aims, and regulatory requirements the retrospective data set may be collected once (one time) or collected once then periodically updated (one time with “top offs”). In the latter case, the DP and EHRI WG in consultation with the HeartShare CCs will determine the adequate scope and frequency of the data set updates. It is also useful to highlight the two cohort categories below: 1.3.1 The Entire Pool of HF Patients with EHR Records This is a broad category and intended to include all HF patients and their appropriate comparator groups with EHR records at HeartShare CCs. Since this category is broad and includes current and past patients who are not HeartShare participants, the regulatory framework for collecting and analyzing their EHR data will depend on obtaining a waiver of HIPAA authorization from the local IRBs and privacy boards. 1.3.2 Patients Enrolled in HeartShare This category is a subset of the category above and includes patients who are enrolled into HeartShare studies via the Eureka platform. These participants provide informed consent and HIPAA authorization for sharing their EHR data, so the regulatory pathway for accrual and sharing of their health information is likely to be more permissive. The accrual of these patients will be ongoing and will include ongoing encounters with the HeartShare CC HF clinics; therefore, this group will likely require regular EHR data aggregation and “topping off” during their active participation in HeartShare studies. This category includes participants in the HeartShare HF Registry (previously referred to as the “light touch registry”), the HeartShare Deep Phenotyping Cohort (DPC), and their comparator groups. 1.4 What EHR Data Are in Scope? The data domains that will be included will be prioritized based on their relevance to the HeartShare scientific goals. Informed by the overall aims of HeartShare and the unfolding of the main studies, the DP and EHRI WG will work to define the EHR domains. The following diagram shows a high-level roadmap of the domains we will be seeking. Note that there will be domains (red) for which there may not be a clear pathway for mapping to the OMOP CDM. In addition to specifying the requirements, the DP and EHRI WG will set guidelines on the procedures for obtaining data from ancillary data sources where they reside. Furthermore, there may be a need to examine the pertinent vocabularies and propose additions where needed. (e.g., by working through the OHDSI community’s CDM Refresh Process.) This will offer an opportunity for the work in HeartShare to inform EHR-based phenotyping in the field in general. 1.5 How Will EHR Data Be Extracted and Prepared for Analysis? There will be two steps for data extraction and harmonization into a format amenable to uniform analysis across all HeartShare CCs. 1.5.1 Local EHR Query: Cohort Identification and Domain Selection. This step is highly variable and depends on the local EHR data stores within each CC. This step will rely on cohort definitions to identify the appropriate patients. 1.5.2 Extract, Transform, Load: Harmonization Using the OMOP CDM In this step, the exported records with the associated domain field values will be transformed into relational database tables that are concordant with the OHDSI OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). 1.6 Where Will the EHR Data Be Analyzed? The HeartShare DTC will work with the HeartShare CCs to develop appropriate data transfer agreements (DTA) that cover the different subsets of patient populations in the shared EHR data. Furthermore, all institutions whose investigators will require access to the data will need to sign a data use agreement (DUA). There are two workflows for data analysis. Scenario 1: local analysis because a DTA is not feasible for a given population or a DTA has not been signed yet, followed by pooling of analysis results Scenario 2: pooling of data into a central location managed by the HeartShare DTC followed by one central analysis "],["heartshare-retrospective-cohort-details.html", "2 HeartShare Retrospective Cohort Details 2.1 Cohort 2.2 OMOP Tables Usage", " 2 HeartShare Retrospective Cohort Details 2.1 Cohort As currently proposed, there will be two cohorts of HF patients whose records are to be included in the OMOP tables. This does not include their comparator groups yet as the cohort definition criteria for them is still being developed. 2.1.1 Historical HF Patients at CC 2.1.1.1 Selection criteria Selection criteria: follow DTC guidelines to identify HF patients (all EFs) in the EHR 2016 onwards (ICD-10 implementation date), namely: Age: \\(\\geq\\) 18, if used age cut off at 30 as had been previously discussed just indicate that Presence of ICD-10 Codes: 2 outpatient encounters or 1 inpatient (for list of codes see below) Please do not use any additional filtering criteria. If you are using any (e.g., BNP cut off value) please indicate that in your response to the DTC. 2.1.1.2 ICD-10 Codes I09.81, I11.0, I13.0, I13.2, I50.1, I50.20, I50.21, I50.22, I50.23, I50.30, I50.31, I50.32, I50.33, I50.40, I50.41, I50.42, I50.43, I50.810, I50.811, I50.812, I50.813, I50.814, I50.82, I50.83, I50.84, I50.89, I50.9 2.1.2 HF Patients Prospectively Enrolled in the HeartShare Study Patients in the HF arms of the HeartShare Study, both the HeartShare HF Registry and the HFpEF Deep Phenotyping Cohorts, are also to be included as they enroll in the study and provide informed consent and EHR authorization via the Eureka app. 2.2 OMOP Tables Usage All the tables are congruent with OMOP CDM v.5.3.1. Required tables are expected to be populated with the data and are listed in bold letters. Optional tables can be left empty for now are listed in gray. A link to the corresponding table definitions in the OMOP CDM is provided for each table. If possible, we ask that patient data for the tables are populated starting 10 years prior to the date patient qualified for the cohort (selection criteria looks in the EHR records starting with year 2016; If patient qualified in 2020, cohort should include patients’ data from 2010 onwards). 2.2.1 Clinical Data Tables https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm53.html#Clinical_Data_Tables PERSON We’ll be collecting patient’s 5-digit address zip codes only. Patient’s most recent address should be stored in PERSON table, in location_id field. More information is provided later, under LOCATION table OBSERVATION_PERIOD VISIT_OCCURENCE VISIT_DETAIL CONDITION_OCCURRENCE DRUG_EXPOSURE If possible, we recommend loading all of the medication data. For sites that are building de novo OMOP tables, selective loading should focus on cardiovascular drugs that fall under the following ATC classes: alimentary tract and metabolism, blood and blood forming organs, and cardiovascular systems. Since the list of rxnorm codes is a long one, provided below is sql code, to run against OMOP vocabulary tables. The code returns rxnorm codes that belong to ATC (sub)class specified in the variable @ATC_code (in the example, all rxnorm codes for ATC class A10 - Drugs used in Diabetes will be returned) -- Returns RxNorm codes for selected ATC class DECLARE @ATC_code AS varchar(10); SET @ATC_code = &#39;A10&#39; ;with t as ( select concept_code, concept_name from [cdm].[concept] where vocabulary_id in (&#39;ATC&#39;) and concept_code like @ATC_code+&#39;%&#39; ) , atc as ( select c.concept_code,c.concept_id, left(c.concept_code,case when len(c.concept_code)&gt;=1 then 1 end) [ATC 1st_code] ,t1.concept_name [ATC 1st_name], left(c.concept_code,case when len(c.concept_code)&gt;=3 then 3 end) [ATC 2st_code] ,t2.concept_name [ATC 2st_name], left(c.concept_code,case when len(c.concept_code)&gt;=4 then 4 end) [ATC 3st_code] ,t3.concept_name [ATC 3st_name], left(c.concept_code,case when len(c.concept_code)&gt;=5 then 5 end) [ATC 4st_code] ,t4.concept_name [ATC 4st_name], left(c.concept_code,case when len(c.concept_code)&gt;=7 then 7 end) [ATC 5st_code] ,t5.concept_name [ATC 5st_name] from [cdm].[concept] c left join t as t1 on t1.concept_code= left(c.concept_code ,case when len(c.concept_code)&gt;=1 then 1 end) left join t as t2 on t2.concept_code=left(c.concept_code ,case when len(c.concept_code)&gt;=3 then 3 end) left join t as t3 on t3.concept_code=left(c.concept_code ,case when len(c.concept_code)&gt;=4 then 4 end) left join t as t4 on t4.concept_code=left(c.concept_code ,case when len(c.concept_code)&gt;=5 then 5 end) left join t as t5 on t5.concept_code=left(c.concept_code ,case when len(c.concept_code)&gt;=7 then 7 end) where c.vocabulary_id in (&#39;ATC&#39;) and t5.concept_name is not null and c.concept_code like @ATC_code+&#39;%&#39; ) select [ATC 1st_code]+isnull(&#39;-&#39;+[ATC 1st_name],&#39;&#39;) ATC_1, [ATC 2st_code]+isnull(&#39;-&#39;+[ATC 2st_name],&#39;&#39;) ATC_2, [ATC 3st_code]+isnull(&#39;-&#39;+[ATC 3st_name],&#39;&#39;) ATC_3, [ATC 4st_code]+isnull(&#39;-&#39;+[ATC 4st_name],&#39;&#39;) ATC_4, [ATC 5st_code]+isnull(&#39;-&#39;+[ATC 5st_name],&#39;&#39;) ATC_5, c.concept_code RxNorm_code,c.concept_class_id ,c.standard_concept, c.concept_name RxNorm_desc from atc d join [heartshare_stg].[cdm].[concept_ancestor] a on a.ancestor_concept_id=d.concept_id join [cdm].[concept] c on c.concept_id=a.[descendant_concept_id] where c.vocabulary_id=&#39;rxnorm&#39; order by d.concept_code, a.min_levels_of_separation PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE If possible, we recommend loading all procedures.

OBSERVATION DEATH NOTE We recommend loading notes for echocardiogram, cardiac cath, and ECG if possible. Our initial priority will be loading echo notes locally. At Northwestern, we intend to use Philter 1.0 text de-identification tool. It has some nice features and it is certified. More information can be found in the JAMIA Open, Volume 6, Issue 3, October 2023, ooad045 article. Another possibility is to use an open source tool from Stanford called TiDE. NOTE_NLP SPECIMEN FACT_RELATIONSHIP 2.2.2 Health System Data Tables https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm53.html#Health_System_Data_Tables LOCATION We’ll be collecting patient’s 5-digit address zip codes only. For this purpose, LOCATION table needs to be populated with all USA 5-digit zip codes. A file in CSV format will be distributed to sites for loading into the table. This will also allow us to explore relevance of socioeconomic status, since various SES indicators exist at zip code level. LOCATION_HISTORY OMOP CDM v.5.3.1 does not have a way to record patient’s historical addresses. That is why LOCATION_HISTORY table has been introduced in OMOP CDM v.6.0. If address history is available for the patients, please create and populate this table. OMOP CDM guideline is that current (most recent) patient address should be stored in PERSON table, in location_id field.

COHORT_DEFINITION table will be used to define cohorts of interest. The table should be populated with records as shown in the table below. cohort_definition_id cohort_definition_name definition_type_concept_id subject_concept_id 1 HeartShare Retrospective 0 1147026 2 HeartShare Registry 0 1147026 3 HeartShare Deep Phenotyping 0 1147026 COHORT Participating sites will be responsible for assignment of patients into cohorts. For subject_id in COHORT table use person_id from PERSON table and for cohort_definition_id use appropriate cohort_definition_id from COHORT_DEFINITION table. For HeartShare Retrospective cohort, use observation_period_start_date and observation_period_end_date from OBSERVATION_PERIOD table as cohort_start_date and cohort_end_date. For other cohorts, use patient’s enrollment date as cohort_start_date and use observation_period_end_date for cohort_end_date. If patient withdraws from the study or completes the participation update cohort_end_date with the date of the event. ATTRIBUTE_DEFINITION 2.2.6 Vocabularies to Load Vocabularies can be downloaded from https://athena.ohdsi.org/vocabulary/list. Size of OMOP vocabularies is typically in the range of ~20GB. At a minimum, it is recommended to use the vocabularies below: ID (CDM V4.5) CODE (CDM V5) NAME LATEST UPDATE 1 SNOMED Systematic Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (IHTSDO) 27-Jan-22 2 ICD9CM International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, Volume 1 and 2 (NCHS) 30-Sep-14 3 ICD9Proc International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, Volume 3 (NCHS) 30-Sep-14 4 CPT4 Current Procedural Terminology version 4 (AMA) 30-Apr-23 5 HCPCS Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (CMS) 30-Jun-23 6 LOINC Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (Regenstrief Institute) 14-Aug-23 8 RxNorm RxNorm (NLM) 2-Jul-23 9 NDC National Drug Code (FDA and manufacturers) 26-Aug-23 12 Gender OMOP Gender 13 Race Race and Ethnicity Code Set (USBC) 14 CMS Place of Service Place of Service Codes for Professional Claims (CMS) 21 ATC WHO Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical Classification 6-Sep-21 35 ICD10PCS ICD-10 Procedure Coding System (CMS) 30-Sep-20 40 DRG Diagnosis-related group (CMS) 41 MDC Major Diagnostic Categories (CMS) 44 Ethnicity OMOP Ethnicity 70 ICD10CM International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (NCHS) 30-Sep-22 82 RxNorm Extension OMOP RxNorm Extension 23-Aug-23 88 CVX CDC Vaccine Administered CVX (NCIRD) 17-Apr-23 115 Provider OMOP Provider 128 OMOP Extension OMOP Extension (OHDSI) 30-May-23 2.2.7 Echo Measurement Echo measurements should be loaded into the MEASUREMENT table. Most of the echo variables could be matched to appropriate LOINC code(s). For variables where suitable standard codes were not found, custom vocabulary and custom concept mappings were created for capturing those values.The echo measurements should be able to be linked to echos in the PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE table. For left ventricular ejection fraction, we recommend mapping the value in the echo reported by the echocardiographer to the most appropriate LOINC code. If the method of measurement is unknown, then use LOINC Code 8806-2, Left ventricular Ejection fraction by 2D echo.
