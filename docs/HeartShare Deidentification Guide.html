and other individually identifiable health information (collectively defined as 'protected health information')" or PHI.</li>
   <li>The HIPAA Privacy Rule defines PHI; defines how PHI can be used; and regulates research on human subjects.
PHI includes MRNs, names, dates, locations, and others.

      <li>"<strong>De-Identified Health Information</strong>. There are no restrictions on the use or disclosure of
         de-identified health information. De-identified health information neither identifies nor provides
         a reasonable basis to identify an individual. There are two ways to de-identify information;
         either: (1) a formal determination by a qualified statistician; or (2) the removal of
         specified identifiers of the individual and of the individual's relatives, household members,
         and employers is required, and is adequate only if the covered entity has no actual knowledge
         that the remaining information could be used to identify the individual."</li>
      <li>"<strong>Permitted Uses and Disclosures</strong>. A covered entity is permitted, but not required,
         to use and disclose protected health information, without an individual's authorization,
         for the following purposes or situations: (1) To the Individual (unless required for access or
         accounting of disclosures); ... and (6) Limited Data Set for the purposes of research,
         public health or health care operations."</li>
      <li>"<strong>(6) Limited Data Set</strong>. A limited data set is protected health information
         from which certain specified direct identifiers of individuals and their relatives,
         household members, and employers have been removed.43 A limited data set may be used and
         disclosed for research, health care operations, and public health purposes, provided the
         recipient enters into a data use agreement promising specified safeguards for the
         protected health information within the limited data set."</li>
      <li>Note 43: Definition of Limited Data Set: "A limited data set is protected health information
         that excludes the following direct identifiers of the individual or of relatives, employers,
         or household members of the individual: (i) Names; (ii) Postal address information,
         other than town or city, State and zip code; (iii) Telephone numbers; (iv) Fax numbers;
         (v) Electronic mail addresses: (vi) Social security numbers; (vii) Medical record numbers;
         (viii) Health plan beneficiary numbers; (ix) Account numbers; (x) Certificate/license numbers;
         (xi) Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers;
         (xii) Device identifiers and serial numbers; (xiii) Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs);
         (xiv) Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers; (xv) Biometric identifiers,
         including finger and voice prints; (xvi) Full face photographic images and any comparable images."</li>

<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
The HHS-HIPAA Guidance lists two methods of deidentification: "Expert Determination" and "Safe Harbor".
Expert Determination requires a statistical review of deidentification methods to show that the
risk of identifying an individual is "is very small".
It doesn't specify any particular threshold or definition of "very small".
Compliance is sufficiently difficult that the Expert Determination method is rarely used in practice.</p>
<p>
The Safe Harbor method is much more commonly used and generally known.</p>

<h2 id="General_Guidance">General Guidance</h2>
   <ul>
   <li>Guidance on Satisfying the Safe Harbor Method:
      <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/de-identification/index.html#safeharborguidance">https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/de-identification/index.html#safeharborguidance</a></li>
   <li>Deidentifying data using the Safe Harbor method requires removing
      "The following identifiers of the individual or of relatives, employers, or household members of the individual".
      (Exceptions for Limited Data Sets are noted for each item.)
      <ol class="upper-alpha">
      <li>Names</li>
      <li>All geographic subdivisions smaller than a state (first three digits of ZIP code may be used if it includes
         more than 20,000 people, as derived from the most recent census)
         <div>(ZIP code is allowed in a Limited Data Set)</div></li>
      <li id="Item_C">All elements of dates (except year) ... all ages over 89 and all elements of dates
         (including year) indicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be

         <div>For the HeartShare data set, the HIPAA advice is modified: For example,
            if the patient's year of birth is 1910 and the year of healthcare service
            is reported as 2010, then in the HeartShare data set
            the year of birth should be reported as either 1900 or NULL.</div>

      <li>Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code (Not required for a <a href="#Limited_Data_Set">Limited Data Set</a>)</li>
      </ol></li>
   </ul>


<h2 id="Limited_Data_Set">Limited Data Set</h2>
<p>
The intent for this project is for the contributing sites to share Limited Data Sets (LDS),
which will contain information still classified as identifiable protected information.
LDS must not be shared except as permitted by a Data Use Agreement.</p>
<p>
"The list of identifiers in a limited data set can include the town, city, or state of the individual,
their gender, and dates relating to the individual." (See <a href="#HIPAA_Journal">HIPAA Journal</a>, above.)</p>
<p>
For HeartShare data sets, full dates (month, day, and year) may be used for all events EXCEPT birth date,
which will be limited to the year of birth only.
Any birth dates indicating an age of 90 or older (as of the date of service) must be replaced by the year "1900" or a NULL value.</p>

<h2 id="Further_Notes">Further notes</h2>
   <ul>
   <li>"Identifying Code: A code corresponds to a value that is derived from a non-secure encoding mechanism.
      For instance, a code derived from a secure hash function without a secret key (e.g., 'salt') would be
      considered an identifying element."</li>
   <li>"Identifying Characteristic: A characteristic may be anything that distinguishes an individual and
      allows for identification. For example, a unique identifying characteristic could be the occupation
      of a patient, if it was listed in a record as "current President of State University."</li>
   <li><strong>Special handling of age and birth date:</strong>
      <ul>
      <li>Any <strong>ages 90 or older should be recorded as 90</strong> (see <a href="#Item_C">item C</a> above).</li>
      <li>Although the rules for a limited data set allow retaining complete dates,
         to help ensure patient privacy, <strong>please limit birth dates to the year of birth</strong> only.</li>
      <li>Further, if the date when patient data is extracted, or any of the structured data items containing dates
         (such as encounter date), is more than 90 years after the patient's date of birth
         (indicating age over 90, including fractions),
         <strong>the date of birth should be recorded as either 1900 or NULL</strong>.
         (Both of these are already present in our data.)</li>
      <li>Date of birth should be expressed as either an integer data type or a character string,
         so that it can be limited to year only.
         If it's necessary to use a date or date-time data type which requires month and day, use January 1.</li>
      </ul></li>
   <li>We have found instances in which the result of a procedure or a lab test contains PHI,
      such as a date (for example, "20220103") or even a patient name ("Homer Simpson's knee surgery completed").
      In addition to being on the look-out for these cases, generally make sure that values that should be
      numeric really are numeric, are in the expected range, and don't conform to known patterns.
      <div>String values should be safe as long as they conform to OMOP vocabularies.</div></li>
   </ul>
