# Active EHR Data Call 

Status: **PROPOSED** (receiving comments)

Target draft approval date: **Monday 2022-12-19**

Target due date: **Wednesday 2022-03-01**


## General Description and Notes

This is the first data call requesting the creation of OMOP CDM compatible table at the HeartShare Clinical Centers. It builds upon the  [initial heart failure data call](#heartshareamp2022) presented during the in-person HeartShare AMP meeting on September 29, 2022, and extends it to familiarize the HeartShare CCs with the OMOP CDM data table generation workflow.

## Cohort

As currently proposed, there will be **two cohorts** of HF patients whose records are to be included in the OMOP tables. This does not include, yet, their comparator groups as the cohort definition criteria for them is still being developed.

### Historical HF Patients at CC

#### Selection criteria

Selection criteria: follow DTC guidelines to identify HF patients (all EFs) in the EHR 2016 onwards (ICD-10 implementation date)

-   Age: $\geq$ 18, if used age cut off at 30 as had been previously discussed just indicate that
-   Presence of ICD-10 Codes: 2 outpatient encounters or 1 inpatient (for list of codes see below)

Please don't use any additional filtering criteria. If you are using any (e.g. BNP cut off value) please indicate that in your response to the DTC.

#### ICD-10 Codes

```
I09.81,  I11.0,  I13.0,  I13.2,  I50.1,  
I50.20,  I50.21,  I50.22,  I50.23,  I50.30,  
I50.31,  I50.32,  I50.33,  I50.40,  I50.41,  
I50.42,  I50.43,  I50.810,  I50.811,  I50.812,  
I50.813,  I50.814,  I50.82,  I50.83,  I50.84,  
I50.89,  I50.9
```

### HF Patients Prospectively Enrolled in the HeartShare Study

Patients in the HF arms of the HeartShare Study, both the HeartShare HF Registry and the HFpEF Deep Phenotyping Cohorts, are also to be included as they enroll in the study and provide informed consent and EHR authorization via the Eureka app.

## Table or Result Specs

For the included cohorts this data call shall include the following tables. All of the table are congruent with **OMOP CDM v.5.3.1**. Unless otherwise specified, we will follow the field requirements (required vs optional) used in the *All of Us* Research Program. A link to the corresponding table definitions in the OMOP CDM and All of Us online resources is provided in each section.

If we cannot secure Data Transfer Agreements for transfer of these data, then the default expectation is that the tables will remain within your institutional boundary. They will need to be amenable to standard analysis scripts which will be provided to your site to run against these well-formed tables.

### PERSON

This is the master table containing 1 row per patient with basic demographics. It should not contain any personally identifiable information

### VISIT_OCCURENCE and VISIT_DETAIL

The `VISIT_OCCURENCE` table references the encouters listed in the EHR for that patient. The `VISIT_DETAIL` is an optional table used to represents details of each record in the parent `VISIT_OCCURRENCE` table

### CONDITION_OCCURENCE

This table lists the conditions associated with that patient. Note that it is possible to link those conditions to the encounters during which they were assigned. This link is optional but would be helpful if included. In this data call, we would expect that the ICD-10 selection criteria listed above to be included as the cohorts themselves are defined based on the presence of these codes.

### MEASUREMENT (LVEF ONLY)

The Measurement Domain is the domain in OMOP concerned with examination or testing of a Person or Person's sample. **For this data call we are only asking to include measurement records pertaining to LV Ejection Fraction**.

**NOTE**: Please note similar to *AoU*, we are requires standard LOINC concepts for the measurement table. Namely only LVEF measurements that map to the following LOINC codes.

LOINC_NUM|LONG_COMMON_NAME
---|---
10230-1|Left ventricular Ejection fraction
8806-2|Left ventricular Ejection fraction by 2D echo
