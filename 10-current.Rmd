# Active EHR Data Call 

Status: DRAFT

## General Description and Notes

This is the first data call requesting the creation of OMOP CDM compatible table at the HeartShare Clinical Centers. It builds upon the  [initial heart data call](#heartshareamp2022) presented during the in-person HeartShare AMP meeting on September 29, 2022, and extends it to familiarize the HeartShare CCs with the OMOP CDM data table generation workflow.

## Cohort

As currently proposed, there will be two HF failure cohorts for inclusion in the OMOP tables. This does not include, yet, their comparator groups as the cohort definition criteria for them is still being developed.

### Historical HF Patients at CC

#### Selection criteria

Selection criteria: follow DTC guidelines to identify HF patients (all EFs) in the EHR 2016 onwards (ICD-10 implementation date)

-   Age: $\geq$ 18, if used age cut off at 30 as had been previously discussed just indicate that
-   Presence of ICD-10 Codes: 2 outpatient encounters or 1 inpatient (for list of codes see below)

Please don't use any additional filtering criteria. If you are using any (e.g. BNP cut off value) please indicate that in your response to the DTC.

### HF Patients Prospectively Enrolled in the HeartShare Study

Patients in the HF arms of the HeartShare Study, both the HeartShare HF Registry and the HFpEF Deep Phenotyping Cohorts, are also to be included as they enroll in the study and provide informed consent and EHR authorization via the Eureka app.
